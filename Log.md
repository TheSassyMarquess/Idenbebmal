Granite 1st, 500

It's a fort I've recently been put in charge of as the expedition leader. I've been instructed my leadership will reign until Granite 1st of 501. My family has a history of mine engineers and as such I've been given this opportunity to establish a new outpost. I was given a rough map of the region, and the chance to select our starting supplies as well.  The location I chose, our prospectors had noted should contain fluxstone, iron as well as a few other metals & sand and clay, all of which were things I was looking for in my planning. They've also informed me of the nice benefit of a small river being in the locale.

With the location mapped, we've got to prepare for the journey. I've taken our budget and massively cut unnecessary expenses for more expensive goods. While I recognize the utility of bringing wooden tools like buckets, splints, crutches, wheelbarrows and the like with us, I trust our carpenter to be of sufficient skill to craft them upon our arrival. Plus the options the merchants offered were of too low quality. I was shocked to see that they kept suggesting I buy pigtail for our cloth, ropes & thread. Spidersilk is half the price! Being a fiscally minded dwarf, I demanded the Spidersilk I knew they had available. With most of the budget savings we've had from the various cuts, I've turned around and spent the money on buying us animals to help establish our outpost. Llamas, goats, and sheep were my priorities, as I know they'll provide our necessary cloth later on.

With our wagon loaded, and six other... unfortunates in tow with me, we've set out to strike the earth!

We've arrived at Paddleglens to establish our outpost, and I'm... pleased with the surroundings. The hills are decent, as we've settled along the foothills of our home mountain range. We've got dolomite, chalk and mudstone exposed along the surface of our new home. In addition we've got a decent supply of trees along our northern area, though much of our new outpost lacks any greenery along the southern portion. It's all a rolling grass plain around the river. The river itself is a small thing, barely deep enough to provoke a risk of drowning. I'm happy to report one of the hills is decently large and tall to support our initial outpost and I've begun laying out our plans to delve into the hill to carve out our lodgings. I've already begun to plan how to carve secure entrances on the hill for access to the fort for ourselves, traders, and potential invaders. We look to have a bright future ahead of ourselves... though my cohorts have admitted their skills are... lackluster in many of the departments we will need. We have no miners, woodcutters, or farmers. Just 2 bards, a noble, a carpenter, a soldier, and a cook. One of the bards is a fisherdwarf at least, and before I could talk with them, they were already running to the river... As for the other bard, they have skill with thread, but in the meantime, I've set them to work with an axe. Our cook likewise has been given an axe and set to work, and the pickaxes were given to our noble and soldier.

First major incident in the fort... one of our bards got into a tussle with a kingsnake. Both seemed to have run away mostly fine, but I admit this is not a promising beginning.

Felsite 4th, 500

Wow, Slate just blew right past huh. We've begun to carve out our lodgings and such out for our initial home. We've established offices for our nobility, and I've begun work as a manager. Our lone soldier is operating as the town sheriff, and the last noble should be sitting down to count all our stocks any day now. Without a mason of any kind, we're relying on our carpenter for most of our furniture right now. Tables, chairs, beds, doors and blocks. I'd prefer stone blocks for our workshops, but we're going to have to make due with birch blocks. The little stone we have that isn't economic stone is going to have to be saved for building some furnaces and such, in case one of the other leaders needs them before we reach magma. Regardless, on this fine day, I'm optimistic for where we're heading.

Galena 3rd, 500

We got our first batch of immigrants in! Two miners, a glazer, an administrator, and 2 peasants. The miners and glazers are both ironically better administrators than the noble, so the glazer's got the job as our broker now, taking that responsibility off me. The miners will join those we'd been having mine prior. The peasants & admin are going to work our fields for now. As well we're putting one of them to work as our stonemason for the time being.

Well Autumn has come, and I feel rather poor on the outpost's condition. We have an internal storage area, but so little has been carved out from what I planned, and the outpost liaison will be here soon. I fear we have little impressive here, and while I sent one of the miners off to begin an exploratory delve below us, we have yet to find much aside from a small amount of cassiterite.

Limestone 13th, 500

I don't know what the next leader is going to want, so I'm requesting imports of materials we either don't currently have, or may not have at all. A few stones, copper bars and ore, as well as some crops, as it might be a nice supplement. I don't care if they buy what I asked to import, but I will try to produce the exports asked, which are primarily amulets and scepters. For my remaining time as the head of our fort, I'm going to be trying to set up some manufacturing of those goods, so we might have something to sell next autumn.

Sandstone 20th, 500

Well we got our final migrant wave this year, I'm pleased about that. Trading could have gone better, and in the mean time, I've sent our miners to go prospecting for gems along the hillsides. Our cook has made his first masterpiece, and I don't know if I should be concerned or not. I think he got inspired by the rumor of planepacked, and decided to planeroast some apples. He's shoved so many different ingredients into his apple roast, I suspect he actually was just grabbing individual apples and shoving them in. He put in almost every piece of fruit we had lying around, considering he made 255 servings of the thing. Why he decided to do this AFTER the traders left, I'll never know. I guess he wanted to eat his roast all by himself, but I could have bought some real nice flour and dyes with that kind of money...

Well... the years over. I managed to delve deep enough to get us some gold with some prospective mining to the west. I smelted the gold and had a set of coins forged to celebrate our first year. 500 gold coins, minted by our cook funnily enough. He chose to put a rendition of The Tin Rock, a finely designed image of a jug on one side, and an image of a millstone on the back. I'd also set up connecting our trading depot by tunnel to our lodgings, and carving a more defensive entrance into our outpost. I'd used the rock we had from mining to get our mechanics to work making mechanisms and set out to build as many rock fall traps as I could on a zig-zagging little path. Likewise, I had a bowyer make us 10 crossbows to get us started defensively. I know metal would be superior, but we don't have any military grade metal to work with at the moment. I'd also managed to set up some production of trade goods like goblets and amulets. Hopefully whoever follows me can find some metal we can use to create a few weapons to wield, otherwise we're limited to the wooden crossbows, and a bronze sword I bought off the caravan...
